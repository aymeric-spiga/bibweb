to create your link.something file, go to NASA ADS e.g.
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/physics_service.html

fill your query as you wish, with filters you want

check the results

then once query is all good, re-submit the same query but be sure to
set "BibTeX with abstracts" in FORMAT

copy paste the link of the submission result to your link.something file

note : you can set your link so that it includes the publications
from the whole team and set filters later in the python scripts!

see examples basic.py mywebsite.py lmdwebsite.py
