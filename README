to create your link.something file, go to NASA ADS e.g.
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/physics_service.html

fill your query as you wish, with filters you want

check the results

then once query is all good, re-submit the same query but be sure to
set "BibTeX with abstracts" in FORMAT

copy paste the link of the submission result to your *.link file

note : you can set your link so that it includes the publications
from the whole team and set filters later in the python scripts!

see example demo.py and more complex examples within folders
